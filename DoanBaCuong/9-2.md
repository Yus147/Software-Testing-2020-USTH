**Section 9.2**
- Ex 1.
 idk
- Ex 2.
a.  The mutant is always reached, even if x = null.
b. Infection always occurs, even if x = null, because i always has the wrong value after initialization in the loop
c. findVal: 
As long as the last occurrence of val isn’t at numbers[0], the correct output is returned
d. Any input with val only in numbers[0] works.


- Ex 3.
- a. 
  - findVal: The mutant is always reached, even if x = null. 
  - sum: If x is null or the empty array, ie x = null or [], then the mutant is never reached

 - b.
   - findVal: Infection always occurs, even if x = null, because i always has the wrong value after initialization in the loop. 
   - sum: Any input with all zeroes will reach but not infect. Examples are: x = [0] or [0, 0].
   
- c.
  - findVal: As long as the last occurrence of val isn’t at numbers[0], the correct output is returned. Examples are: (numbers, val) = ([1, 1], 1) or ([-1, 1], 1) or (null, 0). 
  - sum: Any input with nonzero entries, but with a sum of zero, is fine. Examples are: x = [1, -1] or [1, -3, 2].
  
- d.
  - findVal: Any input with val only in numbers[0] works. An example is: (numbers, val) = ([1, 0], 1) 
  - sum: Any input with a nonzero sum works. An example is: x = [1, 2, 3]
